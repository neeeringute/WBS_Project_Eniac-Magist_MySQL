## Eniac Expansion Analysis: Brazilian Market Exploration with Magist Partnership

### <u>Project Overview</u>


Welcome to Eniac Expansion Analysis, a project aimed at helping Eniac, a leading online marketplace for Apple-compatible accessories, make a data-driven decision regarding its expansion into the Brazilian market. As of summer 2018, Eniac has been a dominant player in Spain and neighboring countries, but the potential for growth in Brazil has sparked interest.

However, expanding into a new market comes with challenges, particularly when Eniac lacks ties to local providers, logistics services, or customer support teams. To address these challenges, Eniac is considering partnering with Magist, a Brazilian Software as a Service (SaaS) company that provides comprehensive order management, shipment, and after-sales services.

### <u>Problem Statement</U>
The decision to partner with Magist is critical for Eniac's success in Brazil. While Magist offers benefits such as economies of scale and reduced delivery costs, concerns remain about its ability to handle high-end tech products and maintain Eniac’s fast delivery times, which are key to customer satisfaction. The goal of this project is to analyze Magist’s dataset and determine if they are a suitable partner for Eniac's expansion.

### <u>Key Objectives</U>
* Assess whether Magist can support Eniac’s Apple-compatible tech products.
* Analyze the delivery efficiency of Magist, especially regarding fast delivery.
* Provide actionable recommendations to Eniac's board of directors based on data insights.

### <u>Data Sources</U>
The data provided by Magist includes a snapshot of their marketplace operations. The database is divided into several key tables:

* `products`: Contains all the products available in Magist's marketplace.
* `product_category_name_translation`: Provides translations for product categories in Portuguese and English.
* `sellers`: Details the sellers registered in the marketplace.
* `customers`: Contains information on customers who made purchases.
* `geo`: Links zip codes, coordinates, and states for precise location tracking.
* `orders`: Captures each order placed in the marketplace.
* `order_items`: Records individual products included in each order.
* `order_payments`: Logs payments made for each order, including installment payments.
* `order_reviews`: Contains customer reviews for each order.

### <u>Project Structure</U>
1. Data Exploration
The first phase of the project involves exploring the Magist dataset to answer essential business questions such as:
* How many orders were placed?
* What percentage of orders were delivered successfully?
* Is Magist experiencing user growth?
* How many tech products were sold, and what was their average price?
* Are expensive products selling well in the Brazilian market?
2. Business Analysis
Based on the data exploration, the next phase focuses on answering specific business questions related to Eniac’s concerns:

<u>Tech Product Categories:</u>
* Does Magist offer enough high-end tech products to make the partnership viable?
* Seller Analysis: What portion of sellers on Magist are tech-focused, and how profitable are they?

<u>Delivery Efficiency:</u> 
* How fast are Magist’s deliveries? Are there any patterns indicating delays, particularly for high-value products?
3. Recommendations
The final deliverable is a recommendation to Eniac's board of directors on whether to move forward with the partnership. This recommendation will be supported by insights drawn from Magist’s data, as well as external research on the Brazilian market.

4. Presentation
A 3-5 minute presentation will be prepared to summarize the findings, providing clear, actionable insights for Eniac’s leadership. The presentation will be created using Google Slides, Canva, or Prezi for real-time collaboration and professional design.
